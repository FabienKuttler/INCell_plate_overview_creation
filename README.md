# INCell_plate_overview_creation
This macros creates plate overviews from images acquired with an INCell Analyzer automated fluorescence microscope. The wells for which no images have been acquired will appear black. Colors can be chosen, grids and well name are added.

## At start of the macro, a first windows appears, allowing the initial settings:

### Plate format
Custom format allows to create a partial plate: the following window allows selection of first and last well of the plate overview

### Number of FOV per well and FOV setup
Custom format allows to set the number of rows and columns for FOV layout through the following window

### Z stack Projection method
If Z stacks have been acquired, an additional window allows the selection of projection method to be applied to each stack, between Max Intensity, Sum slices or Gaussian stack focuser
